## Why Choose CheapPay?

**The Problem**: Traditional payment systems require complex backends, user accounts, and have high minimum payments. Existing crypto solutions are built for e-commerce, not APIs.

**Our Solution**: HTTP-native payments using 402 status codes. Your users pay with crypto they already hold, no signups required.

## Quick Example

```typescript
import { solanaPaymentMiddleware } from '@cheapay/x402-express';
import { TokenMint } from '@cheapay/x402';

// Protect your API endpoint with $0.01 USDC payment
app.use(
  '/api/premium-data',
  solanaPaymentMiddleware({
    payTo: 'YourSolanaAddressHere',
    routes: {
      '/*': {
        price: '$0.01',
        network: 'solana-mainnet',
        mint: TokenMint.USDC.mainnet,
      },
    },
  })
);

// Your protected endpoint
app.get('/api/premium-data', (req, res) => {
  res.json({
    data: 'Premium content unlocked!',
    earnings: 'Every call = $0.01 in your wallet',
  });
});
```

**That's it!** Your API now accepts cryptocurrency payments. Users pay with their Solana wallet, and you receive USDC instantly.
